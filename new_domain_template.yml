# This file is a template for adding or updating an MCP domain in the system.
# When you process this file:
# 1. Parse the YAML content below.
# 2. Read the existing 'mcp_config_index.json' file.
# 3. Check if a domain with the 'domain_name' from this file already exists in the index.
#
# 4. If the domain does NOT exist:
#    a. Add the new domain to the 'domains' object.
#    b. Generate keywords based on the description.
#    c. Inform the user that a new domain was successfully added.
#
# 5. If the domain EXISTS:
#    a. For each server in this template's 'mcp_servers', check if a server with the same ID already exists in the index for that domain.
#    b. If a server ID conflict is found (e.g., 'server_id_1' already exists):
#       i. STOP and ask the user for clarification: "A server with the ID 'server_id_1' already exists for the '[domain_name]' domain. Do you want to overwrite it with this new configuration?"
#       ii. If the user denies, stop the process for that server and continue to the next. If they approve, replace the existing server config with the new one.
#    c. For any new server IDs in this template, APPEND them to the existing domain's 'mcp_servers' object.
#    d. Update the domain's 'description' with the one from this file.
#    e. Generate a fresh list of keywords based on the new, updated description.
#    f. Inform the user that the existing domain was successfully updated.
#
# 6. Write the final, updated content back to 'mcp_config_index.json'.
# ---------------------------------------------

# The unique, single-word name for this domain (e.g., "database", "git", "vector_db").
# If this name already exists in the index, its entry will be updated according to the logic above.
domain_name: your_new_domain_name

# A clear, concise description of what this domain is for and what its tools do.
# This description will be used to automatically generate the keywords.
description: |
  A multi-line description is perfectly fine.
  Be descriptive enough for an AI to understand the domain's purpose.
  For example: "Provides tools for interacting with and managing PostgreSQL databases, including querying, migrations, and user management."

# A dictionary of the MCP servers this domain provides.
# The keys ("server_id_1") are the unique identifiers for each server within this domain.
# If a server ID is new for an existing domain, it will be added.
# If a server ID already exists, you will be asked whether to overwrite it.
